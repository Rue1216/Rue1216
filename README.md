## TL;DR — How to Work With Me

- I prefer **structured, goal-oriented communication** with clear outcomes and follow-ups.
- I value **timely, actionable feedback** or concrete keywords for deeper self-learning.
- I work **slower but carefully**, focusing on effective results rather than just completion.
- I’m most productive with **clear context, sufficient background, and access to data**.
- I have low tolerance for **repetitive work and unprepared discussions** — I tend to automate when possible.

## Detailed ver. — How to Work With Me

_This section describes my preferred working and communication style to reduce friction and improve collaboration._

### Communication

- Please organize discussion topics in advance
- Discuss items one by one
- For follow-ups:
  - Clearly define expected output
  - Set a deadline or next checkpoint

I strongly prefer goal-oriented communication and try to avoid unnecessary emotional noise.

---

### I value feedback that is:

- Timely
- Actionable
- With keywords / directions for deeper self-learning

Regular reviews of goals and deliverables are appreciated.

---

### Working Rhythm

- My thinking is usually clearest late at night
- I often review unresolved bugs in the morning before work
- Slightly slower, but detail-oriented
- I focus on producing **effective outcomes**, not just completing tasks

---

### Common Misunderstandings

- **“Young, ambitious, and idealistic”**  
  → I’m actually quite pragmatic in both life and work.
- **“Using English to sound superior”**  
  → I use English mainly for precision; many technical terms lose clarity when translated.
